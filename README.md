Got it 👍 If you’re doing this **just in Jupyter Notebook** (no Streamlit), then the README should look a little different — more like a **data science case study** than an app.

Here’s a polished README you can use for your Jupyter Notebook project:

# 📊 Netflix Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Overview

This project predicts customer churn for a **Netflix-like subscription service** using **Logistic Regression**.
The analysis includes **EDA, churn driver insights, model building, and risk segmentation**.

The notebook walks through the **end-to-end process**:

* Cleaning and preprocessing customer data
* Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
* Building and evaluating a churn prediction model
* Generating business insights and recommendations

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression)
* **Jupyter Notebook** (analysis & reporting)

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights explored:

* Overall churn rate
* Feature comparison (monthly fee, watch hours, last login days, etc.) between churned & non-churned customers
* Churn % by gender, subscription type, and payment method
* Correlation heatmap of numerical features

---

## 🤖 Model Training

* **Train/test split**: 80/20
* **Model**: Logistic Regression (`max_iter=1000`)
* **Evaluation metrics**:

  * Accuracy
  * Precision
  * Recall
  * F1-score
  * ROC-AUC
  * Confusion Matrix & Classification Report

---

## 🎯 Business Insights

* Customers are segmented into **High / Medium / Low churn risk** based on model-predicted probability
* **High-risk customers** are flagged with suggested actions:

  * Offer discount (if monthly fee is above average)
  * Recommend personalized content (if monthly fee is average or lower)
